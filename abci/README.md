**NB: Currently heavily under construction**

Crate for creating ABCI applications for use with Tendermint. See the
[Tendermint ABCI docs][abci-docs] for more details on ABCI.

## Requirements

- The latest stable version of Rust

## Features

This crate exposes an interface that allows for the construction of ABCI
applications that run using the Rust standard library (i.e. simple
multi-threaded applications), as well as using various `async` runtimes.

Currently, in terms of `async` runtimes, we support [Tokio] and [`async-std`].

These are all enabled/disabled by way of feature flags.

## Testing

To run integration tests for the Rust standard library (non-`async`,
multi-threaded), run:

```bash
cargo test --features client,runtime-std,echo-app
```

To run all integration tests for all supported `async` runtimes, run:

```bash
cargo test --all-features
```

To run Tokio-specific integration tests only, run:

```bash
cargo test --features async,client,runtime-tokio,echo-app
```

To run `async-std`-specific integration tests only, run:

```bash
cargo test --features async,client,runtime-async-std,echo-app
```
